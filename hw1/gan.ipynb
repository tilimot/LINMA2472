    "## Guidelines\n",
    "This homework is done in Python, using the PyTorch library for neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The homework is divided in 2 sections: training a CGAN and explorizing the latent space.\n",
    "This Notebook contains codes to be filled-in. The goal of the homework is to use a GAN for generating handwritten numbers (and letters).\n",
    "    \n",
    "A big part of the code for training your CGAN is already given in this Notebook. Every part that you will have to complete is indicated in the title by a mention. When it implies to write some code, the precise location is mentioned by the line `# TO COMPLETE`. The existing code should be sufficient, but can be modified at will if it turns out to be useful for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the proposed code gives sometimes unnecessary options for the asked tasks, but this is on purpose: this code could become an inspiration/foundation for any future CGAN project that you may have. The overlay should make the code clearer, more robust and generalisable to other possible datasets (eventually your own dataset) or tasks to offer you a better PyTorch GAN framework. Every time additional parameters should not be changed, they will be indicated by the line `# DON'T MODIFY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is done by groups of 3. Once the group is formed, register it as soon as possible in the Moodle activity \"Group choice for Homework 1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for the whole homework is: **Monday 21 October 2024, 23:59, on Moodle**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using AI writing/coding assistant (such as Chat GPT) is allowed, but you absolutely have to detail where you use it, which prompts were given and what answers you received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your questions or comments should be posted on the dedicated Moodle \"Class forum\" or kept for the Q&A session that will take place on: **Monday 7 October 2024, 08:30, in BARB91**. As a last resort, you can send them directly to the mail address: `bastien.massion@uclouvain.be`."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Since their introduction in 2014 by Goodfellow et al., Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have taken a predominant place in the deep learning landscape. GANs are deep neural networks composed of two parts: a generator and a discriminator. Those two parts are trained as opponents (hence \"adversarial\"): from the dataset, the generator tries to create new fake data that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between true and fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the most interesting part of this model is the generator, therefore we often refer to GANs as generative models. Together with diffusion models (such as Stable Diffusion or DALLE-3) for vision and with transformer models (such as GPT4) for language, these generative neural networks make up a large part of the AI world today. Experts think that we are currently living in the era of Generative AI. Lectures about some of those other topics are coming soon!\n",
    "\n",
    "These generative properties are used in a lot of applications: mainly for image processing tasks (style transfer, segmentation, face generation, image inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution,...), but also for natural language processing tasks (text summarization, text generation,...), for music generation or even for medical tasks (tumor detection). Another major use of GANs is data augmentation, which can be successful in any data-driven sector for which collecting large annotated datasets is costly or risky (medicine, biology, psychology,...). Of course, new applications emerge and perspectives unimaginable a few years ago could soon become reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional GAN (CGAN), introduced in 2014 by Mirza and Osindero, is a variation of the classical GAN architecture that aims to give more information to the networks to improve and control the generated outputs. In particular, the generator and the discriminator both receive the class that should be generated or discriminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to implement your first CGAN and explore some properties."

    "## Packages import\n",
    "You will need several packages in order to successfully build, train and use your neural networks. In particular, we use the PyTorch framework and some of its extensions (`torchvision` and `torchinfo`) to work with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, all packages except `torchinfo` should be installed by default. However, it could be possible that some of those packages are not installed yet on the hardware you will be using for this homework. Please install them properly by following the installation guidelines in their respective documentation. If they are already installed, don't hesitate to update the packages to their most recent versions: it will run faster and safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will automatically download the `torchinfo` package if it was not done already.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages are necessary and should not be removed. However, if you want to add other packages for your figures, for timing or whatever, feel free to do so."

    "## Resources\n",
    "Training a neural network is really expensive, especially if your network is large. Moreover, training GANs is famous for its instability, as you might figure out. It is thus important to look for the most suited computing and storing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, parallelisation of computations can speed up the process a lot, by several orders of magnitude. In particular, computing on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which has up to hundreds of cores, will be much faster than on your usual laptop CPU (Central Processing Unit), typically with less than 8 cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is useful to search for the maximum available computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you are encouraged to use (external) GPU solutions. Indeed, staying on your own CPU laptop could take up to several hours for one training session... Here are some solutions to acquire such GPU."

    "The use of the CPU of your computer should be problematic for the training process of GAN, but not for the inference part. Typically, if you just want to create new images from your trained model, your CPU should be sufficient. So, the second part of the project should be doable on your CPU."

    "Colab is a free and easy to use service from Google, where you can borrow their efficient resources. You only require one Google account, i.e. one Gmail adress, to use Colab and run code online.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and easiest way of using Google Colab is to work with a Jupyter Notebook, so this one will perfectly do the job! Launch Colab, in files \"import a new notebook\" and select your Notebook for this homework. The Notebook is stored on the Google Drive associated the Gmail address, while all the related files (data, generated figures, saved models, saved latent vectors) exist in folders on the computing unit that you are connected to, and are stored in the same directory as your Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step with Colab, you can use the free option. In this setting, you often have access to nice GPU's: Nvidia T4 GPU. Be aware, GPU are sometimes not available (reserved in priority for people with paying subscriptions) and there are limitations to the amount of computations that you can do in one go with the free setup (\"usage limits\"), so don't hesitate to start this project as quickly as possible. The whole project is doable on these T4 GPU's: it is our recommended option to make this project.\n",

    "To select your resource, click on the triangle next to \"Connect\" in the up-right corner of your screen (see image) -> \"Change runtime type\" -> Select your \"Hardware accelerator\" -> \"Save\". It should then become \"Connected\" to the hardware you chose.\n",

    "However, we allow you to buy premium resource (click on \"Purchase additional compute units\"). In particular, we will refund one \"Pay As You Go\" subscription per group. It costs 11,19€ for 100 compute units, valid for 90 days. Note that you need a credit card to buy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the refund procedure, you need to keep a proof of payment to Google Colab. After the deadline of this homework, an Excel file will be posted on Moodle and you will have to fill in with your refund information. Finally, you will send the Excel file and the proof of payment in one mail to Bastien Massion (bastien.massion@uclouvain.be), as soon as possible. The refund demand will then be treated.\n",

    "With such compute units, you can get guaranteed access to Nvidia V100 GPU's, which work a bit better than T4 ones. If you're lucky, you could even have access to Nvidia A100 GPU's, which are amongst the best GPU's on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "100 compute units should allow more than 5 hours of computing. You can check your remaining total on: triangle next to \"Connect\" -> \"View resources\". However, be aware that when you possess the paying option, running with T4 GPU's will also cost you compute units...\n",

    "The function `chooseDevice` automatically checks two things. First, it checks whether the run is done on Colab or on you own computer. If you are using Colab, then the source is set up as the Google Drive you are working with. Colab should ask your permission to access your Google Drive and be able to interact with it, accept it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing this function does is to check if there is a GPU available. If there is one, computations will be done there using CUDA, a parallel computing package and programming model created by NVIDIA. The code `.to(device)` is necessary to work with the GPU. It is already added where it should be, but simply be careful of adding everywhere it will be needed if you modify the rest of the code or for your further analyses. Otherwise, computations will be done by default on CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `num_workers` parameter is a bit obscure, but it roughly indicates how many units you would like to use for downloading data. It seems that 2 is fine for Colab GPU, 0 is fine for your own GPU and 0 is fine for any CPU.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, the **EMNIST Letters** set. This second dataset is larger (more data and more classes), which create more impressive results. It contains a total of 145 600 handwritten letters (124 800 train, 20 800 test) from 26 balanced classes (one for each latin letter, lowercase and uppercase mixed). It is optional, but could be used to create more impressive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **EMNIST Balanced** set. This third dataset is a bit smaller but has more classes: 131 600 handwritten letters or digits (112 800 train, 18 800 test) from 47 classes (some uppercase and lowercase letters are split, some are not, and the digits). It is optional, but could be used to create more impressive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every image is originally of dimension 1x28x28, which means that there is only 1 color/channel (greyscale) and that it has size 28x28 pixels (height, width).\n",

    "### *EMNISTDataset*, *SwapAxesTransform* and *ShiftTargetTransform*\n",

    "Any EMNIST (sub)dataset is imported via `torchvision`. For example, downloading the MNIST dataset returns a object of the type `torchvision.datasets.mnist.EMNIST`. It is possible to work directly with this kind of object, but we want to make the code clearer, more robust and generalisable to other possible datasets (eventually your own dataset) to offer you a better PyTorch GAN framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we define another class called `EMNISTDataset`, inheriting from the more general `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` framework. `EMNISTDataset` could be easily modified to account for all types of image datasets (of course, this is outside of the scope of this project). The dataset imported from `torchvision.datasets.mnist.EMNIST` is then included as an attribute in the `EMNISTDataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before defining the class `EMNISTDataset`, be aware that all images in the torchvision EMNIST dataset have their axes swapped for an unknown reason. To remedy this, we first define a transform class called `SwapAxesTransform` which corrects this fault. Also, a fantom class exists in the EMNIST Letters dataset, shifting all target values by 1. The solution is `ShiftTargetTransform`."

    "## Section 1: Train your GAN\n",
    "In this first part, you are asked to train and test a CGAN for the generation of fake handwritten digits (and letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just recall what training a model means in machine learning. It is in fact quite simple: given a model architecture, use an optimization scheme to minimize a loss function (representing the gap between the data and the model predictions) in order to find the optimal values of the model parameters. In this Section, all of these elements are treated one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's maybe first recall the global architecture of the a GAN model. GANs are deep neural networks composed of two parts: a generator and a discriminator. Those two parts are trained as opponents (hence \"adversarial\"). On one side, the generator tries, from random latent vectors, to create new fake data that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are really coming from the dataset. Meanwhile, the discriminator tries to distinguish between true and fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional GAN (CGAN), introduced in 2014 by Mirza and Osindero, is a variation of the classical GAN architecture that aims to give control the generated outputs by inputting (in addition to the latent vector) a label corresponding to what should be generated. In particular, the generator and the discriminator both receive the label, i.e. the class, that should be generated or discriminated. During inference, this label can be chosen by the user, similar to prompts for LLMs like ChatGPT. The figure below illustrates the structural difference between GAN and CGAN.\n",

    "In this project, all latent vectors $z$ are sampled from a multivariate standard normal distribution in `dim_latent_space`, i.e. drawn from $N(0,I_{\\text{dim_latent_space}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is hard for a network to work directly with categorical data such as labels. Therefore, the label should be encoded in some way before being given to the CGAN. The most common and naive way to do this is to use is to use \"one-hot encoding\". The idea is to create a vector with one 1 for the class it belongs to and 0 for every other class. However, this might not be really efficient computationwise and memorywise.  The solution is to let the model find by itself an Embedding vector for each label, in an embedding space with a chosen dimension. This embedding space is continuous and learnable, which improves the encoding of the labels. In practice, the embedding is done using the `torch.nn.Embedding` layer."

    "The Discriminitor takes a batch of 1x28x28 pixels images and a batch of labels associated with the images as input, and ouputs numbers between -inf and +inf (`forward()`). The activation of the last layer represents some likelihood of the image being real or not, according to the model. Afterwards, it goes through a sigmoid function in order to scale numbers between 0 and 1 (`scalingOutputs()`) such that they look like probabilities. An output of 0.0 means that the model is certain that the corresponding input image is fake, and an output of 1.0 means that it is certain input is real.\n",

    "Notice that the `forward(x,y)` function of the discriminator, which is called when doing a \"forward pass\" through the discriminator, receives two inputs: an image $x$ and label indication $y$. Most of the time, $y$ will be an integer (i.e. the label), but we also allow it to be a floating point label embedding vector. This will be useful for interpolation between labels later in the homework.\n",

    "### Optimizers\n",
    "In machine learning and neural networks training in particular, adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm are used and have seen an impressive amount of development over the last 10 years. For your information, those types of optimization algorithms are variants on the famous gradient descent (first order algorithms). On the one hand, the stochasticity (randomness) comes from the fact that we compute the gradient only on one batch at a time, which is a random selection of few data points within the whole dataset. This randomness allows for more robustness against local minima, which is a positive side effect of using batches for training. On the other hand, the adaptivity means that the stepsize is adapted at each iteration using acceleration techniques, giving faster convergence.\n",
