# Homework on INGInious

Two tasks are currently available on INGInious (https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LINMA2472):

- [FirstOrder](https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LINMA2472/FirstOrder) → corresponding to the first part of the project

- [SecondOrder](https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LINMA2472/SecondOrder) → corresponding to the second part of the project

You are required to submit only your file reverse_vectorized.jl.

A [scoreboard](https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/scoreboard/LINMA2472) is available on the platform. On the left-hand menu, you will find a “Scoreboard” tab where you can view the benchmark results for each task.

> [!TIP]
> Trouble understanding the output of inginious ? The [`FirstOrder`](FirstOrder) and [`SecondOrder`](SecondOrder) subfolder contain exactly the files used by inginious to test and benchmark your code. So you can try the exact same code locally!
